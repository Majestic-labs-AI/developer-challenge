# Developer Challenge

"Make a Python program print a string — so exciting!"

### Quickstart

1. Fork this repo (skip this step if you don't have a GitHub account)
2. `git clone` your fork
3. Modify `main.py`:
   - initialize the tree (see image below)
   - write a method that traverses the tree and prints out the data of each node in this order: "`d b e a f c g`". If Python's not your thing, that's
   okay — use whatever language you like. You get a free constructor if you use Python
4. When you're done, commit & push your changes.
